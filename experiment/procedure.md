<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 22px;">1.	On the first page of simulation, there are three boxes to study the subspace of <i>R</i>, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> and <i>R</i><sup>3</sup>, user can choose these sequentially or by their choice.<br>
2.	In each box, click on either “True” button or “False” button for a given statement. <br>
3.	In the same box click on the explanation button to see the explanation for the right answer.<br>
4.	Having gone through the previous steps, user is required to guess the subspaces of <i>R<sup>n</sup></i> for <i>n</i> > 3, as stated on the bottom of the page.<br>
5.	Click on the “Next” button on bottom of page 1 to go to the next page. <br>
6.	This page provides examples to understand the experiment. Example I provides insight to show that a given subset is a subspace while example II provides insight that a given subset is not a subspace. <br>
7.	For Example I, in the Caution section click on the “Choose matrices” button and enter the required values. Click on “Submit” button to understand the caution. <br>
8.	Now in same example click on the “Let” button to understand how to begin solving the problem. Click on the “Then” button and “Conclusion” button sequentially, to understand the complete justification of the given example. <br>
9.	For Example II, in the Caution section click on the “Choose matrices” button and enter the required values. Click on “Submit” button to understand the caution. <br>
10.	Now in the same example II, click on the “Let” button to understand how to begin solving the problem. Click on the “Then” button and “Conclusion” button sequentially, to understand the complete justification of the given example. <br>
11.	Press “Previous” button to go to the previous page.</span>
